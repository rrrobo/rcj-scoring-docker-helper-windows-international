### STEP3: Setup the System
Download the scoreing system from below link.  
[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/rrrobo/rcj-scoring-docker-helper-windows-international/archive/master.zip)

Please unzip completely!!  
![Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrrobo/rcj-scoring-docker-helper-windows-international/images/folder.png)

Duble-click "setup" to start the setup.

Installing...  
![Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrrobo/rcj-scoring-docker-helper-windows-international/images/terminal.png)


When the screen disappears, setup is complete. The system will boot automatically.  
It takes up to a minute for the system to start up after the screen disappears.
When you access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after startup process is completed, the screen of the system appears.  
The scoring system does not support Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge browser. We recommend Google Chrome and Firefox.

**Note**  
If security protection software is installed, the system may not start properly. (If you are using "Norton", there is a report that does not start well.)
In this case, you need to change the settings of the security software. For details, please search with "(Security protection software name) + Docker" etc.
